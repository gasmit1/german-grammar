<DIV class="title">Introduction to German grammar</DIV>
<P>In my 35 years of teaching German language and culture at the university level, I have found that the best foundation for learning a foreign language is a thorough knowledge of its grammatical structure. One then can  fit vocabulary and pronunciation into that structure. This WWW resource is designed to provide a concise, easily navigable overview of German grammar. It also provides numerous exercises for practicing specific grammatical structures and developing accurate pronunciation.</P>
<P>Although this  cannot completely supplant a live teacher in a classroom, it can support self-paced learning and review. I hope that those who want to learn German for enrichment or need it for professional advancement will find this resource useful. I am eager to receive comments from both learners and teachers on its applicability, and how it can be improved.</P>

    <td><P>This toggle switch at the upper right corner of the exercise pages enables you to turn on or off a feature which pronounces German text you click on. The default setting is "ON". If your device's sound is not muted, you should hear that text created with a synthesized voice. It is quite good, and you can therefore use this feature to practice your German pronunciation, so listen closely and imitate what you hear as accurately as possible.</P></td>
