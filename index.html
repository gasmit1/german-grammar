This website is designed to help you do that on your own, by providing a large body of materials for learning, practice and comprehension. The menu below shows the sequence of steps you should follow.</p>

        Your first step should be to learn how to pronounce German words correctly. To accomplish that, read the descriptions of German sounds, listen to words containing them, imitate those sounds as closely as possible, and practice them often. Learning to speak a foreign language is like learning to play a musical instrument. Both efforts require lots of practice.

        After you feel comfortable in German pronunciation, you should move to learning how to construct sentences. This section breaks the elements of German grammar into small, interconnected sections, which are extensively linked to each other. After reading a particular section, click on the exercise buttons <a href="#" class="myButton"><img src="exercise1.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Exercise"></a> next to the tables of examples. These will help you solidify your understanding of that feature.

        The best way to become fluent in a foreign language is through total immersion, ideally in a country where the language is spoken. Unfortunately, that is not always feasible, but fortunately, the internet now offers the possibility of approximating that experience through audio and video. The following sections provide a broad range of exposure to the language. Use them to accustom your ear and refine your speaking skills by listening closely and imitating the utterances.</td>
