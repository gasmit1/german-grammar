In this program, the screens relating to specific sounds show pairs of words which differ from each other only in the sounds under scrutiny.  Thus you should concentrate on isolating the differences between those sounds as you hear and practice them.  In some instances,  comparisons are drawn between English and German sounds, or between German sounds which are more familiar and those which are less familiar to native speakers of English.<p><!-- 
The words used for minimal pairs were taken from Moulton, William G., <i>The Sounds of English and German</i> (1962)</H3><BR> -->
