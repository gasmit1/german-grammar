&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program will help you learn how to pronounce the sounds of German.  On the page for each set of sounds, you can click on words to hear them pronounced by a native speaker.  You must, of course, have a sound card and speakers or headphones connected to your computer, in order to hear them.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you click on any word the first time, the sound file for that word is sent to your computer.  This may take a few seconds. If you click on that word again, you will hear the pronunciation immediately.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If English is your native language, you will have to exaggerate certain lip and mouth configurations in order to pronounce German words correctly.  For example, to pronounce certain German vowels correctly, you must round or spread your lips much more, or place your tongue higher or flatter or further back in the mouth than required for any English vowel.  In general, the muscles of the mouth, lips, tongue, throat and neck must be much tenser for producing German sounds than English sounds.  Some German consonants are articulated at points where no English consonants are, or require less aspiration (release of air) than similar English consonants.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you also wish to learn or review German grammar, you should work through the pages at <A HREF="http://www.wm.edu/CAS/modlang/gasmit/grammar/grammnu.htm">this link</A>.<P>
