Most German consonant sounds are similar to those in English, except that several vary in pronunciation depending upon their environment.  Also, the spelling of some consonant sounds is different in German from in English.<P>
Two consonants to which you should pay special attention are the <I>r</I> and <I>l</I>.  Pronouncing them too heavily is one of the strongest characteristics of an American or Anglo-Canadian accent in German.<P>
Finally, you should make a special effort to localize the <I>ach</I>- and <I>ich</I>-sounds in German (both spelled <I>ch</I>).  These are different from any consonant sounds in English, but are not hard to pronounce once you determine where and how to do so.<BR>
